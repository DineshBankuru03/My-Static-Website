# 🍦 CRAVE ICE-CREAM: UI Interface Documentation

## 🎨 Homepage Overview

The homepage features a full-screen, vibrant background image of melting ice cream, setting a colorful, summery tone. Floating ice cream-themed emojis (🍦, 🍫, 🍓, 🍭) drift from top to bottom in a looped animation, absolutely positioned behind all main elements to create a playful, dynamic ambiance.

## 🍨 Menu Toggle Button

Located at the top-left corner, the menu toggle is a circular button with a pink border and an ice cream emoji inside. On hover, it highlights for interactivity. When clicked, it opens or closes the draggable dropdown flavor menu, remaining accessible from any screen position.

## 🍧 Draggable Dropdown Menu (Flavors List)

This menu appears near the top-left and can be dragged freely. It’s a semi-transparent white card with a subtle shadow and the title **Flavors**. It lists flavor buttons vertically — each button is pill-shaped with rounded corners and a light pink background, turning bright pink with white text on hover. Clicking a flavor dynamically updates the main display area with that flavor’s content.

## 📸 Display Area (Main Section)

Centrally located below the floating emojis, the main section showcases a white translucent card with padding and shadow. It displays the selected ice cream image (300px wide), the flavor name, a short descriptive sentence like “You’re craving for: Chocolate Truffle 🍫”, and an overlay containing the price and an “Order Now” button — which only appears when the user hovers over the image. A fade-in effect animates when new content is loaded, and the image scales slightly on hover.

## 🖱️ Hover Overlay on Ice Cream Image

When the user hovers over the ice cream image, a slide-up overlay reveals the price in bold and an “Order Now” button. The button has white background with pink text by default and turns solid pink with white text on hover, creating a modern interactive experience.

## ✅ Order Confirmation Popup

Clicking the “Order Now” button triggers a center-screen modal popup with the title **“Your order is booked!”** and the subtitle “Just crave until it’s on your doorstep! 🍦”. The modal includes a close button (×), features light backgrounds with soft orange accents, and animates in with a pop-in scale effect. It disappears automatically after 3 seconds unless manually closed, offering quick feedback.

## 🦶 Footer

At the bottom of the page, a simple footer displays the text:
**© 2025 TASTE THE CREAM MELTED ON ICE**
It appears on a light strip background with centered bold text.

## 📱 Responsive Design Considerations

The entire layout is mobile-friendly with flexible, centered elements. The draggable menu ensures no overlap on smaller screens. Scrollbar styles are customized but still accessible. Hover effects and transitions are prioritized for desktop views, but the interface remains functional across all devices.

## 🔁 User Journey Flow

1. User lands on a bright homepage with floating ice cream emojis.
2. Clicks the 🍦 menu button to open the draggable flavor menu.
3. Selects a flavor — the display updates with the flavor image, name, and details.
4. Hovers over the image to reveal price and “Order Now” button.
5. Clicks “Order Now” to see a confirmation popup.
6. Popup closes automatically, letting them continue browsing.

# 🍦 Crave Ice-Cream Interactive Website — UI & Code Documentation

## 📄 index.html – Structure and Content

This is the main HTML file that forms the foundation of the interactive Crave Ice-Cream website. It includes essential UI components like the floating emoji animation, draggable flavor menu, display card section, and footer. The `<head>` section sets up metadata for responsive layout and UTF-8 encoding. The background is enhanced with a `<div id="floatingIcecreams"></div>` that holds animated emojis drifting from top to bottom. A sticky round menu toggle button (🍦 icon) is placed in the top-left corner and controls the visibility of a draggable dropdown menu containing 10 flavorful options, each embedded with `data-name` and `data-img` attributes. Upon selecting a flavor, the central display card dynamically updates with the corresponding image, name, and price details. The default flavor displayed on load is “Chocolate Truffle.” Finally, a footer at the bottom of the page displays branding or site credits, while the `script.js` file is linked at the bottom to control interactivity.

## 🎨 styles.css – Styling and Animations

This CSS file brings visual life to the website by applying vibrant, ice-cream-themed styles and keyframe animations for an engaging user experience. The `body` features a fun and colorful background that evokes the feel of a summer ice cream truck. Emojis like 🍨 and 🍫 float across the screen using `.float-item`, powered by the `@keyframes float` animation. The `.menu-toggle` style defines a sticky circular button, while `.menu-wrapper` holds the draggable menu UI with a clean white card and rounded flavor buttons that turn bright pink on hover. The `.display-area` ensures the ice cream cards are centered neatly, with `.icecream-card` styled to include fade-in animations. A hover effect is applied via `.img-wrapper:hover .overlay`, which gracefully reveals a price label and an “Order Now” button. Additionally, the `.popup-box` styles the confirmation modal with a light tone and pop-in animations (`fadeInScale`), making every click feel satisfying.

## 🧠 script.js – Interactivity and Logic

The JavaScript file powers all the dynamic and interactive behavior on the site. Clicking on a flavor button reads the associated `data-name` and `data-img`, and fetches the corresponding price from a predefined object, injecting a new `.icecream-card` with updated content into the main display area. To animate the background, 20 floating emojis are randomly added to the page with varying positions, sizes, and animation durations. The draggable menu uses `mousedown`, `mousemove`, and `mouseup` events to allow users to reposition it freely. The `#menuToggle` button toggles the visibility of the menu container. The `showOrderPopup()` function generates a styled confirmation box that appears upon clicking the “Order Now” button. This popup has a light theme and disappears after 3 seconds or when closed manually. Global click event listeners detect if any element with the `.order-btn` class is clicked and then trigger the popup accordingly.
